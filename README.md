# Basic-Python-Slot-Machine
This Repository contains a basic sample of a slot machine game created using Python 
This is a Python script that simulates a slot machine game. Here's a brief overview of the code:

The symbol_count dictionary contains the number of occurrences of each symbol in the slot machine, and the symbol_value dictionary contains the payout value of each symbol.

The get_slot_machine_spin function generates a random spin of the slot machine, with the specified number of rows and columns, and the given symbol counts.

The print_slot_machine function displays the current spin of the slot machine.

The check_winnings function checks if the spin resulted in any winning combinations, and calculates the total payout.

The deposit function prompts the user to input the amount of money they want to deposit, and returns the deposited amount.

The get_number_of_lines function prompts the user to input the number of lines they want to bet on, and returns the selected number of lines.

The get_bet function prompts the user to input the bet amount, and returns the selected bet amount.

The spin function prompts the user to select the number of lines and bet amount, and simulates a spin of the slot machine. It then calculates the winnings, displays the results, and returns the net change in the player's balance.

The main function is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to deposit an initial amount, and then allows them to play the slot machine until they choose to quit.
